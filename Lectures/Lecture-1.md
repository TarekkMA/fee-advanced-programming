## Why Java
1. Java enables users to develop and deploy applications on the Internet for servers, desktop computers, and small hand-held devices. And the future of computing is influenced by the Internet.
2. Java was never just a language, it is a whole platform with huge library
3. Java is general purpose programming language
4. Java is the Internet programming language

## Java and the web
1. Java can be used to develop web applications
2. Java Applets
3. Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages
4. Java can be used to develop application for hand held devices such as palm and cell phone

## Java Applets
- Programs that work on web pages are called applets
- To use an applet, you need a java enabled web browser, which will execute the bytecode for you

## History of Java
- In 1991, **Sun** engineers wanted to design a small computer language that can be used for consumer devices.
- Since these devices don't have a lot of power or memory, java had to be small and generate small code.
- Also the language had to produce different bytecode, because manufacturers may choose different CPU.
- Java project was code-named **Green**
- Because Sum engineers had Unix background, java was influenced by C++ rather than Lisp, Smalltalk, or Pascal
- 1.0 version was released in 1996
- 1.1 version filled gaps, improved the reflection feature, and added a new event model for GUI programming
- 1.2 version was released in 1998 in JavaOne conference. In this version GUI and graphics was improved. The version name was changed to be Java 2
- In 2009 Oracle purchased Sun Micro Systems
- Java 7 was relapsed in 2011 with simple enhancements
- Java 8 was released in 2014 with significant changes to the Java language. It embraced a functional style of programming.
- Java 9 was released in 2017
- After 2018 Java versions are released every 6 months.
- Java 11 is LTS long term support version.

## Misconceptions About Java

2. I use XML, so I don't need Java
3. Java is an easy programming language to learn
4. Java will become a universal programming language for all platforms
5. Java is interpreted, so it is too slow for serious application
6. All Java programs run inside a web page
